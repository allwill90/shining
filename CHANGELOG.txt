= 1.3.3

* A bit more sensible reaction when running into a config file that's not valid JSON.
* Fixed negative top CSS property for stage on very long slides.

= 1.3.2 (19/05/2010)

* Always including config.ru.
* Added the iphone plugin. It's iPhone friendly for now. TODO: get it to behave crazy awesome in it.

= 1.3.1 (18/05/2010)

* Fixed stage resizing issues.
* Fixed horizontal centralization by relying on auto margin + position relative. Can't remember why I had that
 and then went for absolute positioning + JS...

= 1.3.0 (10/05/2010)

* Rudimentary plugins system
  - check lib/plugins for 2 examples
* Vendoring by default to address security restrictions with Google Chrome
  - smarter vendoring though, so now only files that are strictly necessary to play a preso are copied.
* Instead of blindly trusting FileUtils, I'm now speccing Shining::FileMethods
