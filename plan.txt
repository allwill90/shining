# Welcome
  Welcome to Shining, one line explanation.
# Why
  Why webkit + CSS.
# Because
  Because Webkit is ahead of everyone else. And CSS3 is presentational. And Webkit
  implements some really cool stuff from CSS3.
# Why bother
  Shining is a framework, like Rails is for web apps, though a lot smaller, and hopefully
  it will stay like that. Presentations are, in a nutshell, words and images.
  And sometimes *cough* audio. But why not really? HTML5 supports all that and video
  without relying on plugins.
# Aimed at who
  You need *basic* skills with:
    - HTML
    - JS
  Most of the time you'll lay down a heading, paragraphs, lists (mandatory presentation
  bullet points), and images (mandatory photos with double meaning).
  So yeah, developers, developers. But hopefully markup enthusiasts too.
# Features
  Some features:
    - write in Haml, compile to HTML.
    - installs via rubygems, gives you a generator a la "rails mywebsite".
    - it's open sauce (that counts as feature).
    - syntax highlighting.
    - anything else you already see on regular web pages (that's really powerful).
    - and... effects!
# Effects
  Many... different... kinds... of... effects.
  In general it's easier (IMO) to make it look better/smoother than something done in
  MS Powerpoint. I never used Keynote in my life so I can't opine on it.
  How easier? All you have to do is add CSS classes onto elements.
  E.g.: <h1 class="shines">Ahoy</h1>  <- this heading shines when rendered
# What are slides?
  Slides are just HTML.
